Scenario: <br>

You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data
visualizations.

About the company: <br>

In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and
returned to any other station in the system anytime.
Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments.
One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.
Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to
do that, however, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why
casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics.

Process:<br>
The Case Study was performed in Python, in Google Colab. See [file](Cyclistic_CaseStudy.ipynb).
<br><br>

Key Findings: 
* The total number of rides taken from June of 2022 to May of 2023 was 4226423. Out of this 2541806 number of rides were from riders with annual membership, making up to 60% of the totall rides taken.
* Classic bikes are the most popular rideable type. They are also the most popular rideable type among annual membership riders, followed by electric bikes. Majority of the casual riders prefer to ride electric bikes, followed by docked biked. However, none of the annual membership riders prefer using docked bikes.
* For casual riders, the most popular days are Saturday and Sunday, respectively. Whereas, for annual membership riders, the most popular days are Wednesday and Tuesday, respectively. Overall, Saturday has the most number of total riders.
Casual riders mostly rent bikes on weekends while members use them consistently throughout the week.
* For casual riders, the most popular month is July. And, for annual membership riders, the most popular month is August. July is also the most popular month overall.
August, July and June have the most numbers of riders. There is a clear rise in the number of rides taken in the months of summer.
* The number of bike rentals by both casual and annual membership riders peak at 5 pm.
The numbers of casual riders grows gradually throughout the day, peaking at 5 pm. Whereas, there are significant peaks in the number of annual membership riders during the morning hours and later at 5 pm.
* The most popular start station for casual riders is 'Kingsbury St & Kinzie St'. For annual membership riders, it is 'Streeter Dr & Grand Ave'. Streeter Dr & Grand Ave is also the most popular start station in general.
<br><br>

Recommendations: 
* Increase marketing campaign targeted at casual riders.The ads could offer special discounts for the annual membership to encourage casual riders to become members.
* Most casual riders prefer electric bikes. Offering to subscribe to electric bikes at a discounted price can encourage more casual riders to buy a subscription.
* Weekends see the most number of casual riders. Designing a new type of subcription plan only for weekend riders can also increase the amount of members. Similarly, a different type of membership plan for seasonal riders will also help increase the member count.
* Out of the top 10 start stations, only 4 have above 50% of the riders with an annual membership. The other 6 stations should be targeted during marketing campaigns to increase the percentage of annual membership riders. Adverstising during the peak hours may also help.
